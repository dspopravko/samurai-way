# Social network

#### Deployed on [gh-pages](https://dspopravko.github.io/samurai-way/).

--- 

#### Social Network is an rather complex online platform, with many sections, redirection and state managing. This app was written in react class components.

---
### Goals

The goal of this project was to explore React starting with class components, higher order components such as connect, component lifecycle, routing, and classic redux.

---
### Web Stack

The main focus of the project was to study the react library and state management, so the web stack itself turned out to be pretty small. In addition to the react and redux libraries, the redux-thunk middleware was added, as well as formik for the login form, and axios for REST API requests.

---
### Problems and process

The main problem of the whole project is the legacy code and outdated libraries, so in its current state it will be easier to rewrite the application again than to update it. Many other complexities follow from this, managing the life cycle of a class component is more difficult than a functional component using hooks, container components introduce additional layers, classic redux has a lot of boilerplate code, and so on.

### Lesson learned
However, dealing with these problems helps develop programmer skills, clearly abstract entities, isolate code and shorten interfaces.
